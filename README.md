# Incognitor

A simple chrome extension to delete your active tab's data.

## Problem Statement

Many of the websites give you a free preview of sites content for a certain number of tries,

For Example: let's say you opened glassdoor, and wanted to look at company reviews without logging in, then you might have tried the following, going onto next step on getting blocked by glassdoor XD:

> Search in your normal tab

> You (might) open it up in your incognito

> Close incognito and open it again


## The Solution

Incognitor (works in both normal/incognito sessions)

## Usage

Once installed, just press (based on your OS), and the page will reload, giving you a clean slate.

> windows Ctrl+I

> mac Command+I

> chromeos Ctrl+I

> linux Ctrl+I
